Github best practices:

git clone is like svn co
give it the https clone url to the right on a github page

git clone https://github.com/rlabduke/molp3.git

git commit is minor deal, do this all the time, works as local opperation
git push is equivalent to svn ci, communicates with online server

git acts kind of like a local server, even unplugged, I have access to version history

git status (constantly)
git log (before merging)

git add : adds a file to the next commit
-adds a new file to tracking (svn A)
-adds a tracked file to next commit (svn M)

git commit -a : bypasses the git add step and commits all files with changes, rather like svn ci
git commit -m : message

git push talks to server
-if you're in a branch this updates the server branch
-merging with master is different

git pull is svn up, basically
fetch from the server, then checkout to most recent

git checkout : local operation, goes to a specific version

git branch : branching is cheap and easy
git branch -a : lists branches

e.g git branch cjw_notebook_edit_removal
branches are made relative to current location; you can branch from a branch

git branch -d "name": deletes a branch (easy for branches that have never been committed, harder otherwise)

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email you@example.com
git commit --amend --reset-author

first push:
git push -u origin "branch_name"
