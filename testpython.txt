This is a reminder file for getting in and out of python on a terminal command line
In = python
Out = control-shift-D  which makes a carrot-D  ^D

Bradley wants me to think about writing a python program to open, parse, sort, and select
MolProbity bug reports.  This will involve learning to open the email error files, 
Identify different parts of the file,
search through them for specific key words, 
find what we're looking for, and put those files somewhere.

Three different errors (at least) should be searched for:
Specify element (atom labels) types (C, O, H, N, etc.)
Unknown charge
ENDMDL record missing at end of input



Here's how to get a file open from inside python:

11:48:46 c3po ~/Desktop/mystuff/Emacs_Folder> python
Python 2.6.1 (r261:67515, Jun 24 2010, 21:47:49) 
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5646)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> txt = open("testpython.txt")
>>> txt.read()

It is very important to CLOSE each file after you open it, so that python doesn't go crazy running around looking for files.

Python will open a file with any suffix;  doesn't have to be xx.py

You have to be in the right directory, though.
